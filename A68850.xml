         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are two bookes that goe under a mothers name; <hi>A Mothers Bleſſing; A Mothers Legacie:</hi> now thou ſee'ſt a <hi>Mothers Teares.</hi> And this laſt containes all. In this a ſorrowfull Mother <hi>weepes for her Child, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for her Child, and cannot bee comforted, becauſe he is not:</hi> Call it a <hi>Mothers Teares.</hi> In this a ſorrowfull Mother pleades for her Child, begs for her Child, prayes for her Child: <hi>That the good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh, would incline his heart to feare the God of his Fathers,</hi> according to the patterne of wholeſome words, call it, <hi>A Mothers Bleſſing.</hi> And becauſe thy Mother, almoſt worne out with <hi>yeares</hi> and <hi>teares,</hi> is now lying downe in ſorrow, and not likely to ſee thy face, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou wilt haſten; ſhee bequeathes this unto thee as her laſt will and Teſtament. Call it a <hi>Mothers Legacie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Child, I think fit to ſatisfie thee in two things, both touching the Impreſſion of this
<pb facs="tcp:14625:3"/> booke. The firſt ſhall giue the reaſon of it: the ſecond ſhall (I hope) put away the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thou mayſt take at it. To the firſt I haue this to ſay, that finding moſt things (as I thought) coutcht in thy letter, which haue and may draw, and hold, the unſtable minds of <hi>nouices,</hi> who haue not <hi>laid the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples right,</hi> I could not, whether for want of witt, or too much propenſitie to talke (both if thou wilt, it is no great impeachment to a woman) coutch my anſwer within the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a letter. Whence it hapned, that a friend deſiring a Copy, tooke a readier way for 500, then he could with his pen tranſcribe one, and ſo printed it beyond the ſeas. And before any of them came to my hands, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe were diſperſed, being firſt taken at the Cuſtome houſe, then ſhrifted for Papiſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſmiſt by a large indulgence: Whence the bookes came to me juſt in the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a Papiſt returnes from his confeſſour. The booke had its pardon: It's true; and his outſide was as faire as <hi>Pilates</hi> hands, but the inſide was <hi>in ſtatu quo prius</hi> as foule as before. The truth is, the booke had ſo many faults, as that it was not fit to paſſe with them. That put me upon ſome ſecond thoughts, which made the booke much bigger; and now it is free for any hand. The <hi>white</hi> it aymes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, is
<pb facs="tcp:14625:3"/> thy returne, which if it hit not, yet I hope it will keepe ſome from going to thee. I know not, ſaid a wiſe man, whether I ſhall profitt him, I doe admoniſh; but this I know, If I warne many, one or another will receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Spread thine hand, and let the ſeed fall, ſome may fall in good ground; <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi> 29. <hi>Let thy hooke alwayes hang,</hi> It is a <hi>Prouerb;</hi> that may bite, thou look'ſt not for, in a time thou think'ſt not of. <hi>Caſt thy Nets;</hi> So is that, though thou tak'ſt not a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, thou maiſt a Trout; ſuppoſe it bee a leſſe fiſh, it will bee welcome. If I cannot catch men, I can bee contented to catch boyes, yea Children: I am a debtor to them. If any thing come: <hi>why ſhould I ſacrifice to my nett?</hi> If nothing, and ſo my night labor be loſt: I know the reaſon. The Lord teach his profeſſed <hi>Fiſhers to caſt their netts on the right ſide of the boate, that they may finde:</hi> Sure this is the time, the waters are troubled. And ſo much for the firſt, wherein I deſire to giue full ſatisfaction, ſo doe I in the ſecond; which followeth.</p>
            <p>If thou ſhalt ſay, thy renting from us will be knowne now. Alas Child, if that could haue beene help't, thy mother would haue put to <hi>both</hi> hir <hi>ſhoulders.</hi> Yea but this will make it more notorious. I cannot tell y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>; but
<pb facs="tcp:14625:4"/> be it ſo; then alſo it will make thy returne the more gracious. And the more ſhall take notice of thy departing from us, the more will praiſe God for thy returne unto us: ſo that this will be no more thy diſgrace, then was that letter of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> a diſgrace to <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> onely let thy returne be like his, <hi>who departed for a ſeaſon, that hee might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for euer.</hi> But ſay what can be ſaid, this is certaine, hee that is truly turn'd, little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes his owne grace: ſo God may haue the glory. I find the Saints boaſting of their infirmities, blazing their faults, none more; <hi>I was a Publican,</hi> ſo <hi>Matthew: I was a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul:</hi> But ſparing in ſetting forth their excellencies, their abilities; if it muſt be done as ſometimes it muſt, that God may haue the glory; it ſhall be done in the third perſon; <hi>The Diſciple whom Chriſt loued:</hi> So <hi>Iohn</hi> of himſelfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>I knew a man; whether in the bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or out of the bodie.</hi> I cannot tell &amp;c.

            <p>Something to thee Reader, at large: the
<pb facs="tcp:14625:4"/> bait is laid for thee too: for I <hi>go a fiſhing.</hi> This book concernes that particular relation thou ſtand'ſt in, as a parent, or as a child, or both. Thou ſee'ſt a <hi>Mothers Teares;</hi> thou ſee'ſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Child hath cauſed them. Art thou a Child? <hi>then heare the Inſtruction of thy Father, and forſake not the Law of thy Mother;</hi> why ſhouldeſt thou cauſe thy <hi>Parents Tears?</hi> Thy Mother hath groan'd for thee already, make her not grone againe: How canſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>A Mothers Teares?</hi> Art thou a Parent? Thy child is a doubtfull commodity: There is a peradventure in all things good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill under the Sunne, that may befall him, except one. It is borne, perhaps it may grow up, perhaps not, and ſo on, perhaps ſo, perhaps not. Thou canſt not ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may die, perhaps not; that is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as other things are uncertaine: if it doe <hi>grow up like the floure, it ſhall be cut downe like the graſſe:</hi> no peradventure there. But in all things, elſe there is nothing thou canſt looke on, that is ſubiect to more hazard. It may miſcarry for want of thy care, ſo may it notwithſtanding all thy care. See what a barren piece of mould thou haſt let unto him! It brings forth nothing of it ſelfe but <hi>briars</hi> and <hi>thornes;</hi> and doe what thou canſt doe, they will ſhut forth. That thou maiſt
<pb facs="tcp:14625:5"/> make it happily fruitfull; thou muſt to <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> thou muſt to <hi>watering;</hi> ſo much thou art bound to doe, for thou art his debtor; more thou canſt not doe, thou art but a man: weedes come up of themſelues, good corne not ſo: fleſh is propagated, not ſpirit. Thou canſt but ſpeake to the eare, by all thy <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by all thy <hi>wat'ring;</hi> it is <hi>God that boares it,</hi> ſo <hi>giuing your increaſe.</hi> Thou canſt not adde to the <hi>ſtature,</hi> the one or the other: yet let me thruſt in one thing by the way; I finde obedience pre'ſt upon the parent in many places, as a ſpeciall meanes to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No. <hi>And with thy ſeede after thee.</hi> A ſtrong motive to obedience. But ſtill here is a brittle Barke, and it muſt paſſe through a tempeſtuous ſea; every little gale toſſeth it, a greater indangers it. Pray, that grace (a commodity thou canſt not ſtoo in him) may ſet him vpright, and keep him ſo. I ſay, <hi>pray,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, oft and againe, that the <hi>keeper of Iſraell</hi> would ſo ſteere him off the Rockes, where there will be ſhip wracke, as that he may not cauſe his <hi>Parents Teares:</hi> they will be bitter ones; for I can tell in experience, that one Child is unto the Parents as the two basketts of <hi>Figgs</hi> to the Pallet: when good, very good,
<pb facs="tcp:14625:5"/> then ſweet, very ſweete: he is their <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the <hi>Parents ioy.</hi> When bad, very bad; then bitter, very bitter: he is a <hi>Benoni,</hi> all their ſorrow: hence <hi>A Mothers Teares.</hi> Beleeue it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Child is a kind of a thing lapt up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like a pretty bundle, thou maiſt call it a bundle of Cares, but that's to generall: There are three things wrapt cloſely in it; one, as thou maiſt be, thou ſhalt feele before thou ſee'ſt it, and that is <hi>Labour</hi> or <hi>Sorrow,</hi> the other comes to thy hand preſently, and ſticks to it like bird-lime, thou canſt not ſhake thy hands off it; and that is <hi>Care.</hi> The other, which is <hi>Comfort,</hi> thou maiſt meete with, but thou knoweſt not when, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found, it may ſlip from thee, thou knowſt not how ſoone; but in place of it, thou ſhalt be ſure to feele the firſt againe perhaps in more extremitie.

            <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>THis Booke hath yet a further Reference unto thee, then what the Mother hath told: For that it concernes that High Relation alſo, thou ſtandeſt in towards God, to whom thou oweſt <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> becauſe thou callest him <hi>Father:</hi> And feare, becauſe thou cal'ſt him <hi>Lord:</hi> in whom all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meet, as lines in their Center; and from whom they receive both light, motion, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For be it thou art a Governour, thou muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Lord. Be it thou art a ſervant, (ſo is a Sonne too under age;) thou muſt obey in the Lord. And herein the more or leſſe Idolatrous thou art, the more or leſſe faulty. Now if thou ſhalt ſay, the Caſe is well with thee, for thou art no Idolator, my Anſwer is, thy heart may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, and ſurely doth. Indeed I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, that, if thou haſt not ſhut thine eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cleare light, thou art not ſuch a Child in yeares or underſtanding (Be it thon art not fit for ſtrong meat,) but that thou do'ſt loath and deteſt Idolatry in the generallity, &amp; maine tenents of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As firſt, that the Myſticall Body the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:14625:7"/> which is leaſt in ſight, ſhould have an Head on earth, ſo viſible, as a Tripple Crowne will make it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that a Supreame power ſhould bee given to him, &amp; to others, a power ſo ſubordinate, as that they, though the Lords anoynted on earth, (I doe not read the Popes are ſo) ſhould bee but fit to kiſſe his holineſſe feete, when as an unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly dog ſtrained curteſie, and bit his toes.

            <p>Thirdly, That hee who hath his foundation in Clay, what euer, they who giue titles to men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of him, ſhould be <hi>planted</hi> ſo <hi>high</hi> aboue his Predeceſſor <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſo ſome would haue it) as that the <hi>ſhot,</hi> whereby <hi>Peter</hi> was hit, cannot reach his Succeſſour.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That he ſhould keepe a faire for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> and <hi>pardons, Excommunications, Bulls</hi> and <hi>Curſes,</hi> and I know not what: As if he had ſo much intereſt in God, as to make him pardon man for his profit: Or as if <hi>Balak</hi> had ſo much power in <hi>Balaam,</hi> that hee could make him curſe, where God will bleſſe: follow not thou the counſaile of <hi>Balaam,</hi> to mixe thy ſelfe with strangers, and to follow their workes, ſo drawing a Curſe on thy ſelfe, and <hi>Balaam</hi> though hee bee upon his Aſſe, and forward on the way, ſhall not hurt thee.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14625:7"/>
            <p> Fiftly, That the conſtitutions of the <hi>Popes</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardinals,</hi> are of divine Authority, when as thou maiſt giue more credit to an old wiues tale.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That the word, which is <hi>the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power of God vnto ſaluation,</hi> and is <hi>profitable to teach, to inſtruct,</hi> and <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> ſhould, notwithſtanding the neceſſity &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, be lockt vp in an vnknowne tongue, when as, beſides what thou haſt well obſerued from <hi>Paules</hi> words, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Thou art verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that thy ſhepheard takes more felicity with his Dogg, then in hearing him pray or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, whoſe language hee underſtandeth not. <hi>Aug. de Ciuit. Dei lib.</hi> 19. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, That the Virgin mother may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Sonne, whereas <hi>ſhe rejoyceth in God hir Saviour.</hi> And that the Saints, may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated, as <hi>Interceſſors,</hi> though not as <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> whereas there is but one that <hi>ſitteth to make interceſſion for us,</hi> euen <hi>he that ſitteth at the right hand of his Father.</hi> This and much more, thou calleſt groſſe Idolatry, a <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> which may be <hi>felt,</hi> and is, by all ſuch, as are not blinded, with ignorance, as it were by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: <hi>who profeſſing themſelues to bee wiſe, are become fooles,</hi> and having <hi>chang'd the truth of God into a lye, are now delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto ſtrong deluſions, even to belieue</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14625:8"/> 
               <hi>lyes.</hi> And thus much, for that, I am verily perſwaded of thee; my hope reacheth yet further concerning thee: That whereas thou haſt ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo often reprooued for their <hi>Faſts,</hi> their <hi>Prayers,</hi> their <hi>Almes;</hi> excellent things in themſelues; thou haſt thence concluded, that workes auaile nothing, unleſſe they proceede from a touched and religious heart; unleſſe they doe not in name only agree, but are in truth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to our profeſſion: for that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with truth, not with ceremonie; with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not with forme; with mercy, rather then ſacrifice; with obedience, rather then the fat of Lambes; with cutting off the right eye and arme, not with caſting away the baggs. And all this, conſidering what the Lord ſaith in the firſt of <hi>Malachi: In every place ſhall be offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, a pure offering; but curſed be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaver, that hath in his flocke a male, and offereth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: offer it unto the Governour: will he bee pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon? I am a great King, ſaith the Lord, and my name is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe (which is a conſequent from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and may be for explication) whereas thou readeſt of dead works, and a dead Faith, which like her that liued in pleaſure, haue but a name onely; thou haſt thence concluded, that it is not the
<pb facs="tcp:14625:8"/> bare doing of any thing, that brings the doer into acceptation with God: But that there is ſome more inward thing, that witneſſeth to the worker, that he is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom his perſon is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and through whom the action is accepted. And this alſo, conſidering what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruite of it ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye abide in me. Ioh.</hi> 15. 4. Conſidering alſo what the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>By faith</hi> Abel <hi>offered a more excellent ſacrifice then</hi> Caine: <hi>But without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi> Heb. 11. 2. &amp; 6. which conſideration, if it hath put thee upon the purſuit after faith, wherby thou art faſtned to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as cloſſe as the <hi>branch</hi> to the <hi>Vine;</hi> It is impoſſible thy workes ſhould be dead.</p>
            <p>Againe (which is ſtill for explication) whereas thou haſt read in one place a plaine reproofe for <hi>holding downe the head like a Bullruſh;</hi> and in another, a plaine command: <hi>But thou when thou faſteſt, anoint thy head, and waſh thy face;</hi> that is, ſeeme leaſt, when thou do'st moſt; thou haſt thence concluded, that God is pleaſed with ſinceritie of life and manners, not with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall ſeuere ſeeming habit; With a broken and contrite heart; not with ſtrange expreſſions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, ſet forth in a poore and auſtere life of many orders amongſt the Prieſts in their ſundry acts of penance, wherein they deale with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:14625:9"/> 
               <hi>Bedlam-like;</hi> or like <hi>Baals Preiſts.</hi> And this, conſidering God ſaith, <hi>rent your hearts, and not your garments;</hi> I add for explication, nor your skins neither, the skinne is the outward garment of the ſoule: As they might not vnder the Law, ſo may not we under the Goſpell, disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure our ſelues in mourning. <hi>Zachariah</hi> foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the mourning that ſhall be by thoſe one whom the power of <hi>grace and ſupplications</hi> is pour'd, expreſſed it by two liuely compariſons; their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhall be like his, whoſe <hi>coale</hi> is <hi>put out, who hath loſt his onely ſonne:</hi> It ſhall be like that mourning, which was for good <hi>Ioſiah:</hi> that was an extreame mourning. Now how ſhould this be performed? The experience of <hi>Sions</hi> mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can tell you this, for there is the ſame ſpirit in them, as in the text. <hi>They ſhall mourne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very familie apart, and their wives apart.</hi> I know outward expreſſions of this ſorrow, may be, nay are, and will be; it is hard to bite in that ſorrow, nor is it expedient: yet the direction muſt be followed; <hi>but thou when thou faſteſt anoint thy head. Matth.</hi> 6. For cloſe hereof, I adde this. The outward geſture hath then a comely poſture, when a touched heart commands it. An hearty ſorrow is ſeene in the face. It is true: <hi>Deprendas animi tormenta, deprendas et gaudia: ſumit utrum<expan>
                     <am>

<pb facs="tcp:14625:9"/> expreſſion of the ſame even in ſight, may be as neare as <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in their race, but ſtill the firſt is more intenſe, more lasting; it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runnes the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Againe, and laſtly, when thou art commanded to beware in giuing <hi>almes,</hi> that thou be not thine owne trumpet: Corrupt nature is much pleaſed with that muſicke: And that upon thy prayers thou must <hi>ſhut the doores;</hi> that is, do all in <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> before him, who <hi>ſees in ſecret, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards openly:</hi> thou haſt thence concluded, that it is moſt ordinary for a man truly religious, to doe the workes of a ſyncere Chriſtian, and yet not to be ſeene or marked, for feare of applauſe from others, and ticklings from his owne heart, which he would not haue to be his reward; and therefore would not giue the leaſt advantage that way. And then, as thou wilt not diſalow publicke acts of charity, or raſhly iudge their miſcarriage (for who art thou, that dareſt iudge anothers worke outwardly good, though, through the frailty of humane nature, there is great hazard of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage) ſo nor dareſt thou conſure a man for his not ſo frequent working, or not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at all to thy knowledge: And this, for that the proper ſeat of Religion is the <hi>heart,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede alwayes ſetts the hand, and mouth on worke, opening both, but yet moſt times ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the left hand cannot know what the right
<pb facs="tcp:14625:10"/> hand doth. By this thou perceiueſt what a faire hope is conceiued of thee. Firſt I will tell thee why; then thou ſhalt know alſo, that thou art not yet quitted from Idolatry. Why? <hi>The Lord hath given his word unto Iacob, and his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to Iſraell. Hee hath not dealt ſo with other nations, nor haue the Heathen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his law. The word of God, the will of God, the law of God, the teſtimonies of God, David</hi> calls them his <hi>counſellers</hi> alſo: hee ſaw wonders in them, they made him <hi>wiſer then the auncient, then his teachers.</hi> This <hi>word of God</hi> I ſay, is ſet before thee, mauger the malice of Divell, and Pope, tranſlated into thy mother tongue: It is, notwithſtanding the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſuch a iewell, the loathing of ſuch <hi>Manna,</hi> rained downe round about thy <hi>tents:</hi> nor ſo only, it is committed unto thee at this day; if thou wilt reach forth thine hand, thou may'ſt open it; if thou wilt open thine eyes, thou may'ſt reade it: It is a <hi>ſealed book</hi> indeed, but to none, but ſuch, whoſe contempt hath cloſed the eye, who haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iuſtruction: So then, God is not wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and I hope that thou haſt not beene wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to thy ſelfe, thou haſt not <hi>neglected ſo great ſalvation.</hi> There is the reaſon of my hope, that thou haſt ſeene by this cleare light, and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too, that the ſenſes of ſome Papiſts are ſtupid, and their ignorance monſtrous, and thou haſt
<pb facs="tcp:14625:10"/> prayed for them: <hi>Lord lighten their eyes, els they ſleepe in death:</hi> Now looke home: ſearch thine owne tent, turne up the furniture too; for thy heart will keepe hir I dolls as cloſſe as <hi>Rachell</hi> did, when thou maiſt thinke thy ſelfe as cleare of them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> his tents.

And certainely thou maiſt ſay of this ſinne, as the Apoſtle concerning death; <hi>the laſt enemie that ſhall bee deſtroyed is death:</hi> So the laſt ſinne that ſhall be deſtroyed in thy heart ſhall bee Idolatry: I meane, the Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the creature, ſomething wrought by thee, or ſomething wrought in thee: It being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>pitch,</hi> and upmoſt <hi>peg</hi> in Chriſtianity: (Yet ſo <hi>high</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A LETTER WRITTEN FROM <hi>DOWAY</hi> 6 OF <hi>MARCH</hi> 1627. VNTO HIS MOTHER.</head>
            <p>DEARE MOTHER, It is not the firſt time ſince my departure that I have writ unto you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it be the laſt. Nature will finde a way to vent her duty were ſhee never ſo hard oppreſt. Out of ſight is not out of mind, for were you but as mindefull of your ſelfe, as I am of you, I doubt not but by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, you ſhould finde mee a dutifull Sonne. But as the blinde who ſee not themſelues, thinke all others not to ſee them likewiſe, ſo you forgetting your ſelfe, thinke mee forgetfull of you to. God knowes before whom one day I am to give an account, of my duty towards you, how that there paſſeth not a day, or night either, when you and yours take your reſt, wherein there is not interceſſion made for you. If I knew what els in this my ſtate a Childs naturall obligation could effect, in the behalfe of a Mother; I would with what indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I could accompliſh it. But alas Deare Mother, when your requeſt is unreaſonable, nay unnaturall, as the forſaking my Religion, Gods Church, his truth, nay himſelfe, it ſtands not with the duty of a Sonne any way to yeeld in the leaſt to ſo uniuſt demaunds of a Mother. O that your deſires were but of that nature (of that good Mother wee reade of in the Maccabees was.) who did encourage her Children to ſuffer even to death for God. I doubt not but God would ſo ſtrengthen mee with his grace, that you ſhould find my duty as ready to obey, as your piety would bee willing to command:
<pb facs="tcp:14625:12"/> Though it bee not common for a Sonne to teach his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but rather to follow her in what ſhee ſhould direct him, yet when parents miſled from the way of truth, ſhall without knowledge, command what is contrary to Gods will, and their Childrens conſcience. It may be, nay it is the part of a dutifull Sonne, to remember that their command is amiſſe, and cannot bee followed. All I here now doe is no more; I doe but informe you that the happineſſe you wiſh mee is not true and reall happineſſe. That not longer I now, but your owne ſoule might bee the obiect of your thoughts: That you would from henceforth no longer be a ſtranger from the truth. But ſubmit your ſelfe to her, who as a loving Mother would receive and embrace you, with all affection within the armes of veritie; firſt be inſtructed by her, Deare Mother, and then ſhall you learne to governe and guide your owne Children in thinges that are good. And then I am ſure they will bee ruled and guided by you. And this is all ſhould I doe leſſe, I ſhould thinke with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle that I were farre worſe then an Infidell. For how can I behold wolves which pray not for you, but prey upon you, and hold my tongue. Where were my duty? I perceiving you toſt up and downe in the waves of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, as you are, and your ſelfe ready to ſuffer ſhipwrack, and I not ſo much as offering you my hand to draw you into the Arke. Which of all thoſe blind guides, that now pervert your ſoule, will affirme, that the foundation on which your ſalvation purchaſed ſo dearly by the blood of your Saviour, &amp; on which your faith is built, is unfalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If fallable, why doe you hazard your ſalvation pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſo dearely by the blood of your Saviour, upon ſand Deare Mother, I as a poore Child of your owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells, as upon my bended knees, in all duty of a Sonne, doe deſire you conſider your owne declining age, &amp; tho laſt iudgement; (and if you doe not now here in time) worke a prevention of that fearefull ſentence, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:14625:13"/> muſt paſſe upon you, (that ſo you may avoid the wrath to come) endeavour ſomewhat to examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all be true your falſe prophets preach unto you, or at leaſt whether they practiſe what they preach: Firſt try, and then truſt. And becauſe your capacity cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a better argument, then to examine the lives of your profeſſors of your owne ſect. There begin See firſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your new upſtart miniſters do not like ſtage players trickt up in their neat apparrell onely, and barely act, and talke, and practiſe nothing; they will tell you of Chriſts paſſion, his povertie, his want, his hunger and thirſt, his humility, his patience, his labour and travell, his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie, in being apprehended, ſcourged, ſpit on, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his croſſe: they will alſo tell you of the Apoſtles po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie, their ſufferings, their wrongs and afflictions, but who is he, either of your Miniſtry or Laity, will follow your Saviour in theſe his paſſions, who is there among you, that in your ſelves allow either of faſting, or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or voluntary poverty, or good workes, or afflicting your ſelves for Gods ſake: to be deſpiſed, to forſake the world, &amp; live for ever auſterely in pennance for ſins; they can commend theſe things in Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and yet forbid to be practiſed by themſelves. They will tell you that our Saviour payd the price for us, whereby we are become heires of God, co-heires with Chriſt, and being heires, we ſhall inherit, though we ſuffer nothing. For Chriſt both ſuffered and ſatisfied for us; but they will not ſee what followeth. For where the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us heires of God &amp;c. he addeth immediately, if yee ſuffer together with him; ſignifying that wee are heires with Chriſt, upon condition, that we ſuffer with him, to the end wee may bee glorified with him; for we are not freed by our Saviours paſſion from ſuffering, but the more invited, or rather obliged thereunto; witneſſe our Saviour himſelfe, he that will come after me, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, and take up his Croſſe, and follow mee;
<pb facs="tcp:14625:13"/> But contrary if you will but look into Gods Church, you ſhall not onely find Chriſt ſpoken of, but truly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You ſhall ſee thoſe, whoſe onely ioy is in afflictions for Chriſts ſake, whoſe ſong is that of the Apoſtle, God forbid I ſhould reioyce in any thing, but in the croſſe of Chriſt. Who have forſaken all, and given their whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to maintaine the poore, &amp; ſo committed themſelues to the providence of God: we have not thoſe who barely commend vertues in our Saviour, but follow them in deed; alſo they are ſuch that talke little, faſt hard, pray much, ſuffer continually, they are in want, and that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, to helpe others: Poore they are in meanes, but poorer in ſpirit; and theirs onely is the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I will adde no more, leſt I ſhould ſeeme rather to preach you a ſermon, then to write you a Letter. Deare Mother, ſee and be acquainted with thoſe, who both of this faith and life amongſt you, I am ſure their good wayes will better informe you in this kinde then my Letters. And that you may be the ſurer ſatisfied, let the travells of any of my brethren make triall, and let them not doubt, but that they may be as ſafe, and as well for their calling, and travell here, as in <hi>England.</hi> I live in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> a halfe weekes iourney from you, truſt my brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love towards them for their ſafety, at one of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> houſes in <hi>Doway</hi> you ſhall finde mee; I could rather wiſh to ſee any of my brethren at <hi>Doway,</hi> but I pray you if you will not take ſo hard a iourney for my ſake, at leaſt let mee heare from you.

For ſinne ever ſetts forth before puniſhment, and many times gets ſtart of it, that a man would think it had quite out-run the puniſhment: yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment comes ſlowly, but ſurely.

               <p>Yes for marke my Leaders words, wee uſe them but as a devout repreſentation of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Triumphant; which is fit to bee made; in the time and place of prayer.</p>

               <p>I ſay nothing of the Church Triumphant, or of that proportion, which is betwixt the the repreſentation and the thing repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, turne we to Deut. 4. 15. <hi>Take good heed (for ye ſaw no manner of Image) leſt yee corrupt your ſelves, and make the repreſentation of any figure.</hi> See here: <hi>ye ſaw no Image, ye ſhall make the repreſentation of no figure:</hi> wee doe uſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, as a repreſentation. What call ye this, but with a <hi>whores forehead, to walke in the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſſe of your owne hearts:</hi> yee ſhall not, yet ye will doe contrary to the expreſſe charge of God: therefore as theirs, ſo your ſervices are accompted no better, then <hi>ſacrificing to Divells, Deut.</hi> 32. 17. Whoſoever walkes contrary to Gods revealed will, ſhall find the Scripture an adverſarie, and contrary to his way in every page. <hi>Agree then with thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie while thou art in the way:</hi> For ye can no more waſh your hands from <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14625:29"/> then their following generation could theirs from innocent blood. Therefore that thou may'ſt be pricked in thy heart, I returne to the ſecond of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where we find the <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Idolatry; The meane man boweth downe, and the great man humbleth himſelfe, therefore forgive them not:</hi> wherefore? they <hi>bowed,</hi> they <hi>humbled.</hi> Marke it; the iudgement is tied to <hi>bowing</hi> and <hi>humbling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive them not!</hi> had thy Mother ſome <hi>rhetoricks</hi> now, what could ſhee doe with it? <hi>Elocution</hi> thrice repeated, could do no good here: This is a iudgement beyond expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is the utmoſt of all Iudgements. Why? The horſe may trample out the braines of a man, and ſtamp his body to pieces; yet there is hope in that death. The Canon may daſh the body like a ſnow ball throwne againſt the wall; yet there is hope in that death. The <hi>ſword</hi> may bee made <hi>fat with the blood of the ſlaine;</hi> there may be <hi>wailing in all streetes,</hi> and <hi>crying out in all high wayes, Alas, Alas:</hi> yet there may be hope all this while; for theſe things <hi>fall alike to all, and no man knoweth love or hatred.</hi> But <hi>forgive them not.</hi> What think you?</p>
               <p>A man might here enquire, &amp; with <hi>ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> too, why the Prophets tongue was thus ſteel'd againſt the people: he ſeem'd more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14625:30"/> then a <hi>Son of thunder,</hi> his <hi>words were ſwords</hi> even <hi>bitter words. Lord forgive them not!</hi> on would haue thought, that he ſhould have <hi>ſtood</hi> in the <hi>gap,</hi> and have ſaid, <hi>Lord forgiue them.</hi> Yea, but the <hi>Prophet that hath a dreame may tell a dreame.</hi> Ierm. 23: but he that <hi>hath the word, he ſaw concerning Iudah and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Iſaiah 2. 1: muſt <hi>ſpeake the word faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:</hi> and <hi>when the people ſhall aske, what is the burden of Lord? the Prophet muſt anſwer, I will euen forſake you, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Iere. 23. 33.</p>
               <p>Conſider we now: here is an heavy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; can the exalting of a peice of wood procure ſuch a puniſhment? Conſider wee againe, that ſillie man would not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a block: <hi>and that iealouſie is, the rage of a man. he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance,</hi> Prov. 6. 34. Conſider alſo, that the <hi>name of the Lord is dreadfull,</hi> he will bee <hi>ſanctified</hi> of <hi>all that come neere him,</hi> for hee is <hi>a conſuming fire.</hi> This puts vs upon <hi>Dauids</hi> words, let vs call for his ſpirit: <hi>my fleſh trembleth for dread of thee; and I feare for thy Iudgements:</hi> Pſal. 119. 120.</p>
               <p>But if thy heart continue yet ſtiffe, thou haſt made thy ſelfe liable to <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> ſin, which brought deſtruction upon him like a <hi>whirle-wind: The Lord hath done thus and</hi>

Good Child conſider it; and ſince I cannot give thee my right hand of fellowſhip, yet the Mother and Child would faine bee together, they would not a few miles ſhould part them, much leſſe ſuch a gulfe; let us, before thy hand bee pluck't backe, ſeriouſly debate this thing, by what hath beene ſaid, by what ſhall be ſaid; which is ſafeſt, which ſureſt; my comming over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, or thy comming over unto us, that if it may be: we may be together, here, and hereafter for ever with the Lord.</p>
               <p>Attend then further to what I have learn'd from <hi>Pauls planting, and Apollos watering, God giving the increaſe:</hi> we acknowledge but one <hi>Church,</hi> firme and ſtedfaſt as the <hi>foundation of the everlaſting Hills;</hi> compared to <hi>Noahs Ark,</hi> as in many reſpects; ſo alſo for this; becauſe as out of that there was nothing but death, ſo out of this there can be no ſalvation: And therefore as <hi>Noah</hi> having Gods ſpeciall order for the matter and forme of it, had alſo his inviſible hand to guide it: So likewiſe hath this Church that <hi>watchman of Iſrael,</hi> for its
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14625:31"/> Pilot; therefore, though it be in continuall dangerin, yet ſhall it be preſerved from the raging waves of this ſea, &amp; be ſafely brought to the <hi>haven, where it would bee.</hi> And for its more ſure direction, this <hi>keeper of Iſraell</hi> hath appointed at a moſt <hi>certaine and infallible ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereunto all the Prophetts and Apoſtles give witneſſe; and thereunto it doth give diligent heede, and firme aſſent;</hi> becauſe the Authority and teſtimony therof is alwaies the ſame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon Gods unchangeable ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. As for the Popes ſucceeding <hi>Peter,</hi> the Church findeth not the truth of it in hir Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies; and it may be as doubtfull, as the ſucceſſion of <hi>Peters Cocke,</hi> whoſe Pedegree notwithſtanding (they ſay) hath beene line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawne from generation to generation, and it is Cock-ſure. But yet call your Pope what you will, <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Ioane,</hi> (you know it was doubtfull once) yet is hee of the ſame mould with Peter, and may erre as hee did: <hi>whereupon Paul reſiſted him to the face, for hee was to be blamed,</hi> Gal. 2. 11. And therefore whatſoever he ſaith, challengeth no other then an humane conſent unto it: for if all the men in the world, (not immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, as were extraordinary <hi>Prophets &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in whom the ſpirit ſpoke and teſtified by them,)</hi> ſhould conſent in one; as they, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

But let us examine the former ſpeech: If ſo be that words make a Commentary on the heart, as well as acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (they ſay they doe) and the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes a man, as well as the other, then I can diſcerne no difference, betweene that man we now heard of, and this I am now tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you of; who very wiſely put his drink into a ſive; and becauſe the ſive deceaved him, and let his drinke out, would not bee perſwaded afterwards to truſt his diſh, no that he would not.

The ſacrifice holy, though <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes were wicked. That the offering of the Lord was abhorred, was the peoples fault. Yet woe befell them, who gave the offence, and it ſhall certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all ſuch as goe on in their ſteppes. But all this while there is no warrant for abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the offering.

Nay, (I am not wide if I ſay) it brings a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power, then that of your Popes keyes, though it cannot open Purgatorie. But for thy information, which I ſpecially intend, I will plainly ſhew thee what power this is, which trueth brings with it, by two reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances: It is ſuch a power, as <hi>Iacob</hi> gave his Father <hi>Laban,</hi> to ſearch his tents, for the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages which <hi>Rachell</hi> had ſtollen: ſhee was deſirous to keepe them, whether to play with them, or becauſe they were hir Fathers, I know not: and <hi>Laban</hi> was deſirous to haue
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14625:45"/> them; they were his gods, therefore of great eſteeme. Search my tents (ſaith <hi>Iacob)</hi> there is your power: I would give no way to keepe them upon any condition, if I knew of them; <hi>For Iacob knew not that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell had ſtollen them:</hi> Gen. 31. 32. So then <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> was too hard for them both. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance lyeth thus. Trueth brings power with it to ſearch the heart, yea to ſweepe it and cleanſe it too. And yet this crafty ſubtle <hi>Rachell</hi> keepes ſome of the filth behind the doore in a corner. And this to humble man; who, if he knowes nothing by himſelfe, yet is he not thereby juſtified: He hath to doe with him who is greater then the heart, whoſe eyes are as Chriſtall. <hi>Selfe-puritie</hi> is a fancie, it will deceive a man like a <hi>broaken tooth,</hi> or a <hi>legg out of ioynt: Behold, if we ſay wee know it not, doth not he that pondereth the heart conſider it &amp;c?</hi> Prov. 24. 12. <hi>Who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his errors? cleanſe thou me from ſecret ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now marke how <hi>Hezechiah</hi> prayed: <hi>The good Lord pardon every one, that prepareth his heart to ſeeke God, though hee bee not clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the purification of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> That man who is as deſirous to cleanſe his heart from Idolls, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was to cleanſe his tents: and can ſay with <hi>Hezechiah: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:14625:46"/> 
                  <hi>how I have walked before thee in trueth and with a perfect heart:</hi> 2 King. 20. that man may find comfort from Gods anſwering <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiahs</hi> prayer; <hi>And the Lord hearkned to Hezechiah and healed the people:</hi> 2 Chro. 30. 18. 19. I ſhould now ſhew this power, which trueth brings in a ſecond reſemblance; but I cannot leave this ſcripture, there being ſomething elſe in it conſiderable, and pat for our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rachell</hi> had ſtollen hir Fathers gods; no queſtion but ſhee would keepe them: and what meanes uſeth ſhee for that? ſhee hides them under the furniture, then ſitts downe cloſſe upon them. This was a principall means firſt to wipe hir Fathers noſe of them, and then to keepe them above ground; for till ſhe roſe, <hi>Iacob</hi> could not burie them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oake: we may ſitly call this hir wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. But wilfulneſſe, though it bee a kind of a reaſon, ſuch as it is, yet it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to defend it ſelfe, we call it a madneſſe rather; how then did ſhee defend hir wilfull ſitting ſo cloſſe in hir Fathers preſence, and upon ſuch pretious things? For that ſhee pleades cuſtome. So now this Scripture hath afforded us two principall helps, by which you maintaine Images at this day; they are the very pillars, which keepe them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14625:46"/> to the ground. Yee reſolve to keepe them, therefore you ſit downe cloſſe upon them. This is a ſtrong Argument: this will is a tough &amp; knottie thing. And yet that this wilfulneſſe may not bee counted madneſſe; ye plead cuſtome from ancient dayes: let an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient dayes ſpeake. It is ordinary with you to ſay, you hope, your great Grandfather is in heaven, yet he bowed before an Image. It is hard to prove that, becauſe there were ſeven thouſand, <hi>who bowed not the knee before the Image of Baall.</hi> But ſee here, though they cannot uſe a more Herculean Argument, then wilfulneſſe; yet if ye will aske for the old way, and enquire of auncient dayes, (which I am ſure would faile you) here is a Scripture would ſtand you in ſtead, for it drawes the Pedegree of Images, from more ancient dayes, then were my Fathers: And we do grant your Church had a being long before <hi>Luther;</hi> and that your ſtrange gods are as ancient as the oake beyond <hi>Sechem:</hi> yet that you may not thence conclude their lawfulneſſe, they lay buried there; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is no true <hi>Iacob,</hi> but thinks them fitteſt under ground: But if there be any one, who will ſay to the dead ſtocke, ſtand up; he muſt uphold them by wilfulnes, or by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cuſtome, or both. Here I have beene
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14625:47"/> out of my way, yet not from my purpoſe, I come to another reſemblance, wherby that power which trueth brings with it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare alſo.</p>
               <p>It is ſuch a power, which <hi>Ioſuah</hi> had to carry all before him; yet the men of <hi>Gibeon</hi> were too wilie for him: yet the <hi>Iebuſite</hi> dwelt in the Land: The one made their peace by working wilily: The other ſtood to it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt had the Cittie in a kind of ancient poſſeſſion, which is 12. points in the law: and ſo rooted, and earthed himſelfe in the Land, as you ſee Ivie doth into a wall. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one compare the <hi>body of ſinne</hi> unto Ivie in a wall: the Ivie doth ſo claſpe the wall, as that it cannot be taken forth, till the wall be pluck't downe; nor can that ſinne bee purged, till the building bee diſſolved: The <hi>Iebuſite</hi> held out till <hi>Davids</hi> time. But marke. the reſemblance goes further: The firſt were hewers of wood, and drawers of water, to all the Congregations. <hi>Anger, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, feare, &amp;c.

               <p>Now Child, that thou maiſt make ſome uſe of this obſervation. Thou haſt beene looking on our practiſe; call it our carcaſſe if thou wilt, becauſe it hath no life in it: yet as dead as it is, it might yeeld ſome honey, if thou wert wiſe. I read of one, whoſe name
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14625:48"/> is as a ſweet oyntment; that he never lookt on ſuch an object, but he would ſay; Lord be mercifull unto me. He knew the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man had done that thing; and who knowes his depths? he knew a cunning <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> had an hand in it too, even that which is deceitfull above all things; &amp; who knowes his ſlights? to this man this carcaſſe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded honey. But if thou canſt not make this uſe of it, as every one cannot; yet beware thou ſtand'ſt no longer ſtill looking on it, as they on <hi>Amaſa's</hi> body. That may tell thee the danger: I want ſtrength to take it out of the way; nor can I finde a cloth wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cover it. I counſell thee to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten forward: Thy owne corruption hath got much advantage, and more ground it getts continually; never more then when thou ſtandeſt looking at others: It hath got a ſtrong hold, nor is thy heart faithfull within thee, to caſt this rebell out. Oh ſtand not ſtill, but purſue this enemy even to death; looking up to him, him only, whoſe ſtrength is perfected in weakneſſe. Here is a difficult worke, and the hardneſſe of it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this; the getting the conſent of ones will, which is a ſtubborne thing. And that cannot bee ſaid to bee willing and pliable in deed, till it is as content to faſten upon the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14625:48"/> meanes, as it is to enjoy the end. <hi>The ſoule of the ſluggard deſireth, and hath nought.</hi> Prov. 13. 4. <hi>Hieromes</hi> tranſlation of that verſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very ſtrange to me, but (I hope) it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved uſefull: I take it rather as a comment, then a tranſlation. He reads the words thus; <hi>vult et non vult piger;</hi> The ſluggard wills &amp; he wills not. It implies a kind of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the will, and that is ſtrange; yet but ſeemingly, and there is the uſe. For that man who deſires and wills, how covetous ſoever he be, and yet is not diligent, but turneth on his bed, like the doote on his hinges; he getts not forward; where he was, there hee i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; that man in deed and in trueth wills not. Why? he is not diligent: therefore be not miſtaken, he doth not will the end; for the deſiring of the end in deed and in truth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the meanes in ſinceritie. This ſaying, <hi>if there be a willing mind,</hi> rocks many aſleepe, and keepes them as faſt on their bed, as the doore on its hinges. But diligence muſt try whether there bee a willing mind or no: if no diligence, no willingneſſe: thou canſt not thinke of a thing more conſiderable. Thou ſeeſt now what uſe I would have thee make of our practiſe; I would have thee mend thine owne practiſe, by looking on ours. So thou haſt my counſell; now thou

               <p>Then you muſt mend your Coppie; It is voluntarie beggerie. Here good Reader thou ſeeſt my child hath urged <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> that booke he read and ſuch like before the Scriptures, nay before he had layd the firſt principles, and ſo was poyſoned. Hence <hi>thoſe tares:</hi> let them teach thee, to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures as thy Counſellors: throgh Gods bleſſings upon it, they will make thee wiſer then was <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> In the meane time know, they are the Soveraigne Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt poyſon. Now thou ſhalt heare a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14625:61"/> woeman contend with <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> A booke I never read, but a skilfull Fiſherman hath fiſhed out of that booke, ſomething to my hand, which I ſhall ſet downe for my childs inſtruction and thee too, till thou findeſt a better help. It is true: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that This, <hi>Goe, ſell, giue &amp;c-</hi> was not <hi>Chriſts</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but his Counſell: and that not to the young man alone, but to all the faithfull.</p>
               <p>We will not contend about words; call it precept or counſell, (I confeſſe their is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) It was ſpecially directed to one, and it teacheth all. I pray you give me leaue to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe upon <hi>Chriſts</hi> words though like a woeman.</p>
               <p>Thou wouldeſt get heaven by doing, and thou thinkſt thou art come to a <hi>nothing more; what lacke I yet?</hi> doeſt thou underſtand the <hi>voyce of words? They that heard could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that which was commanded; and Moſes ſaid, I exceedingly feare and quake. Hebr.</hi> 12. And yet wouldſt thou get heaven by doing? ſomething is behind that ſhall tell thee, thou art too forward, yea that nothing is yet don. Thou haſt kept the Commandements: that ſhall be tried. What canſt thou doe for thy <hi>brother, whom thou haſt ſeen? canſt thou draw forth thy ſoule unto him?</hi> I doe not mean thy outward parting with thy goods. Canſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14625:62"/> thou doe it according to the perfection of charity, which the Law requireth? Nay canſt thou doe it according to that meaſure which the Goſpell requires, if the cauſe of the Goſpell calls for it? <hi>Though thou bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all thy goods to feed the poore, and haſt not Charity, it profiteth thee nothing.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Thy money is thy treaſure man, thy heart is upon it. Thou muſt part with thy treaſure, when thou maiſt keepe thy money. Thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections muſt be taken off; thou muſt <hi>bye as if thou boughtedſt not,</hi> thou muſt <hi>enioy as if thou enioyedſt not.</hi> This makes thee ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full now. Thou art then exceeding faulty in the ſecond table toward thy <hi>brother, whom thou haſt ſeen:</hi> Thou art infinitely ſhort in the ſecond table towards <hi>God, whom thou haſt not ſeen.</hi> Thus you ſee, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord tried this yong man in that; which was his treaſure indeed, for his heart was on it: <hi>he ſorrowed, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi> The Lord feeles the pulſe of a man, and can make him bleed in a right vaine.</p>
               <p>Now if you will conclude hence, that no man can bee juſtified by the workes of the law, (which I take to be the genuine ſcope of the place) we conſent, though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth not. That he who failes in the ſecond table, muſt needs faile in the firſt; we grant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14625:62"/> that too. We goe further; if you will prove hence, that a man muſt caſt away his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: we grant that too, meaning that, what ever it be, being a creature, on which the Heart is rivited. But if you will conclude hence, that it is Chriſts counſell not to the young man alone, but to all the faithfull; <hi>goe caſt away that civill right, which thou haſt to the talent given thee to uſe;</hi> I will put thee to prove it out of <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and when thou haſt done, thou ſhalt begin againe, and prove it from the Scripture, elſe I will not beleeve it: ſo much to the Counſell. To the practiſe of the Apoſtles I have this to ſay: Chriſt had told them by occaſion of this rich mans departing ſorrowfull; <hi>It was hard for a rich man to enter into heaven: Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> without a great meaſure of grace. Let none be grieved he is of low degree, if hee hath a competencie: Adverſitie hath ſlaine a thouſand, proſperity ten thouſand. This man though young was ſorrowfull to heare of parting with his poſſeſſions; they lay too neare his heart. <hi>Then anſwered Peter, we have forſaken all, what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> What had they forſaken? A houſe, and old netts, and friends too. As ſmall as you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, all was forſaken, for they left them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nothing. And this all, might be great
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14625:63"/> matters; for a poore fiſher man hath ſlept as quietly in his boat, and upon land in his thatcht houſe, as an Emperour in his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; perhaps more quietly, for great dores let in great cares. And this is a truth too: A man loves his houſe, or what you will, <hi>not becauſe it is a great one, but becauſe it is his owne;</hi> and therefore may he bee as loth to part with it, as a rich man with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſtone. We will grant that, the Apoſtles forſooke <hi>All;</hi> and that they had not done it, but that they knew, hee that called them, would recompence the loſſe, though <hi>Peter</hi> was too haſty. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hence, that a man may warrantably caſt away his poſſeſſions, and then confine himſelfe to a Cloyſter; I ſhall never beleeve him: becauſe this man hath not a calling to it; the Apoſtles had: <hi>Come follow me,</hi> This man mu'eth himſelfe up in a hole; the other were ſent forth to publiſh the glad tidings of the Goſpell, a great worke. Again, Chriſt called them; it was their beſt way to follow: there is no danger in following Chriſt, what ever the way bee; Chriſt is a ſure guide: But they could not follow him like ſnailes with their houſe on their heads, or with the netts on their backes: The Scripture doeth not tell us, they left the propriety they had
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14625:63"/> in their houſe, or in their netts: if they did, they were called to it, and the matter was not much; thoſe netts were not to catch men: we have not done with this Scripture yet. My Child quotes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and that truly; who concludes, that the Apoſtles did live the life of beggars; therefore the Monks doe beg warrantably. I could ſay, it followes not; ſtill urging the <hi>Call,</hi> which makes a maine difference: the one were called, and muſt obey; the other were not called, yet they will be in wants and that willingly. But I will never grant that the Apoſtles beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or lived a beggars life, it is much one; yet we will ſee, from what premiſes <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> concludes it: which are theſe. <hi>The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had forſaken all.</hi> The Apoſtles might <hi>provide neither gold, nor ſilver,</hi> Matth. 10. The Apoſtles did not worke with their hands; therefore they lived <hi>vitam mendicantium,</hi> in my Engliſh, <hi>a beggars life.</hi> I ſhall not medle with perſons; the Cardinall in his booke yet liveth, yet ſpeaketh; but very ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, very unmannerly: therefore is he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the hands of a woman, who by the help of the Scripture, will confute <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> He ſpeaks ignorantly; for thou art to know, that he who brings his ſervants into ſtraights, knoweth well how to deliver his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14625:64"/> ſervants out of the ſtraits: he ſpeaks unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy too, and upon that I will inſiſt a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their ſhall be no begger in Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh: and ſhall there be <hi>beggars in Iſrael af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit?</hi> It is not probable. <hi>David</hi> had obſerved much in his youth, ſo had he in his age: yet <hi>he never ſaw the Righteous forſaken nor his ſeed begging their bread.</hi> Yea but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a King you will ſay, the righteous might goe a begging for ought he knew, hee was in his Pallace: he little ſaw the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of his ſubiects: yes ſure, his eares were open to the cries of his good people.

It followes not, my purſe hath often times ben empty, yet I thanke God, I never begged, I would much rather worke with my handes, and I will preſume, ſo would the Apoſtles too, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would have begged.

               <p>Againe, would <hi>Paules</hi> hearers plucke out their eyes, to doe <hi>Paul</hi> good, that is, they would part with the deareſt things? and can we thinke, that the Apoſtles hearers would not draw forth a morſell of bread, or a diſh of drink, to refreſh empty ſoules, unleſſe they begged it? But it will be ſaid, though I make the beſt of it I can, yet the Apoſtles liued upon the liberalitie of others, which is <hi>vita mendicantium,</hi> beggar-like. Pray you let us ſee how this followes: A man is liberall to me, I accept it, therefore doe I live beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-like? It is, as I have ſaid, an uncivill concluſion. But let us examine, whether the Apoſtles did live upon others liberality. I find not the Scripture ſaith ſo: let me put in a houſwiues ſimilitude; I have ſpun a pound of flaxe, I expect ſixe pence for my labour, I can ſcarce live on that; for you ſhall find that a poore bodies labour is the cheapeſt commoditie in the market: call you this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie: I ſay my worke is worthy of my wages, if it were more. Gods Apoſtles (for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14625:65"/> they be ſent) doe diſpenſe unto us ſpirituall things: we let them partake of our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls: what a matter is this; not ſo much as the ſix pence for flaxe. Chriſts words clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then the Apoſtles will not feare, but he that paid the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> for their burdens, and righted him who ſerved a <hi>long ſiedge,</hi> will ſee their wages paide, they ſhall not begg. Now if any will yet take his warrant hence, that he may part with his poſſeſſions, and then begg an Almes; I have no more to ſay to him from this text, <hi>Iubea miſerum eſſe libenter,</hi> which I Engliſh thus, let him be in want &amp; in ignorance too willingly.</p>

Alas, a little money is eaſily turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver board, when the Philoſopher keeps his treaſure, that vvhich is nearer then his skirt or skin: ſo doth that Hermit too, it is a venture elſe, but I judge no mans heart: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I vvould have thee to knovv, and make uſe of it too; that there is great difference betwixt the emptying of a purſe, and the emptying of the heart: The one will emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whether thou wilt or no; the other will not be emptied doe what thou canſt. The one hath money in it, thou maiſt keepe it if thou wilt, at leaſt if thou canſt, it is not a ſtraw matter: the other hath a treaſure in it; thou muſt not keep it, thy ſoule lyeth upon it.

I conclude hence, that though the emptying of the purſe to ones hands, may help to the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart; yet therefore the worke is not done, perhaps in no forwardneſſe: For the purſe may be emptied, yet the heart may be full; but when the heart is emptied, the purſe will not be kept full.

Life is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thing, ſpecially in man, in whoſe litle world, nature hath put every member in office, which is faithfully executed for the good of the whole; to teach man, that he muſt be in ſome office too, &amp; he muſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge it, for the good of himſelfe, and others. Now if I find this man out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for ought I know, he may be found dead yet. I propoſe then unto him another queſtion, ſo anciently asked, and reſolved

Sir what occupation are you off? I cannot imagine how he ſhould anſwere to this; for it is granted by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he is a beggar, and though I have heard in way of contempt of the trade of begging; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a beggar hath no more a trade, then a louſe hath, which is wholly imployed in feeding it ſelfe, and hurting others. I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion him further; Sir, doe you enjoy the bleſſing of God on them that feare him, which they conſider as a fruit of Gods love, and as a reward of their obedience to the commademenr of labour and travell to be undergone in this world by the Children of men, <hi>to humble them thereby, being borne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as the ſparkes fly upward?</hi> What is that? <hi>They ſhall eate the labour of their hands,</hi> that is of their diligence. The more I aske, the more unreſolved. My Child indeed ſaith, his mind is imployed. If according to Gods ordinance for the good of himſelfe &amp; others, we grant it a calling. But to this my Child ſaith no more, but that he <hi>prayeth hard and</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:14625:73"/> 
                  <hi>long;</hi> which is an exerciſe of the generall calling, but very aſſiſtant to the particular, the onely thing in queſtion: nor am I any way ſatisfied with his long prayers; It is a ſuſpicious thing; I have heard of widowes houſes have been devoured under pretence of long prayers. And though I judge no man ſo farre; yet I am ſure there were fatt Friars once; for they had the fat and creame of a land flowing with milke and honey. I know better how they loſt it, then how they gott it. I could queſtion him yet further, as an heathen queſtioned a poore man, who after the burning of his little cottage, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good ſumme of money: Did hee not ſett his houſe on fire himſelfe? Doth not this man find more eaſe, &amp; partake of more fatneſſe then before? This is the laſt doubt; becauſe I know many have left thouſands, chooſing rather to be in want and that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. But the maine doubt remains: When he kept his goods, he ſhould have lived in a calling, ſo ſhould he after he parted with them. I cannot poſſibly find he doth. And ſo much for that he doth not. I come to the ſecond thing; that which he doth: <hi>his whole eſtate is caſt away, and he committs himſelfe to the providence of God,</hi> ſaith thy letter. And doth he ſo; I queſtion his warrant. It is a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14625:73"/> truth; the providence of God is a large and ſure inheritance to his choſen; It ſhewed <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>Ramme,</hi> where and when he little expected it. It provided <hi>Samſons</hi> drink, and <hi>Eliiabs</hi> meat, by ſuch a meanes, as they little looked for; A drie bone yeelded the one, a Raven brought the other. But mark, this is only when ordinary meanes faile. <hi>God will be ſeene but onely in the Mount.</hi> I muſt not, I dare not part with my ſheepe, in expectation to meet with one in the Buſh; nor with my bread, in hope that a Raven will bring me more: I muſt not let my plough ſtand ſtill, I meane my indeavour in what calling ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe God can ſpread a table in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: I know he can, but I muſt not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from his power to his will. The Lord did ſpread a table. Where? In a wildernes: he ſent neither <hi>Quailes</hi> nor <hi>Manna</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> there the <hi>Plough</hi> might goe. God will not feed me from heaven, when I may take up my meat from the earth: He works not extraordinarily in a fruitfull land. Now put theſe together, <hi>what he doth not, and what hee doth;</hi> and learne this from me: Ever ſuſpect that mans prayer, whoſe hand is idle. An Heathen man hath a leſſon, and me thinke it comes double to a Chriſtian. <hi>God is to bee called upon by the hand. I deſire the end:</hi> how
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14625:74"/> knowes he that? Why <hi>volo et totâ mente vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.</hi> My mind is intent upon the meanes; I indeavour my utmoſt, as if there were no providence: And yet I reſt upon a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as if my indeavour were nothing. A Chriſtian may find much uſe from it, both in his generall and particular calling. <hi>Aſa</hi> ſet his battell in array, and cried 2 Chron. 14. It is as obſervable likewiſe what <hi>Ioab</hi> did and ſaid 1 Chron. 19. Whether he was a good man or no I define not, ſure he was a good generall. The ſluggard would have his meat; it is true, <hi>for he lusteth;</hi> but then the Raven muſt bring it him: the Raven comes not, for the ſluggard hath nought: But <hi>the ſoule of the diligent ſhall be made fatt.</hi> As it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to commit ones ſelfe to Gods mercy, Lord, Lord; and yet fit ſtill the while: ſo is it dangerous to commit ones ſelfe to Gods providence, and indeavour nothing. I never heard of any mans will, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd his ſoule to God; let the living man be carefull to prove his will in his life time by double diligence; as by two ſure witneſſes: For certainly, as the ſluggard hath loſt his meate, ſo will he venture his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie. I am now lapping up that which was laſt ſaid, as cloſſe together as I can; and let the Child hearken, even every one who is a child in underſtanding.</p>

               <p> Thou muſt truſt God with the bleſſing; he truſts thee with the meanes: if thou art not a wiſe ſteweard in the one, thou doſt fooliſhly expect the other.</p>
               <p>Againe, when thou ſeeſt thy way, walke in it, and goe down unto Gods providence by meanes, as by ſtepps and ſtaires; ſo maiſt thou lay thy ſelfe downe upon it, as upon a bed of Camamile ſafely.</p>
               <p>Againe, doſt thou perceive no way? art thou in a wilderneſſe, and canſt diſcerne no path? in a ſtrait, and ſee'ſt no meanes? yet grope not for them in the darke by any meànes; but reach forth thy hand unto the Lord willingly as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; he <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and went out, not knowing whither.</hi> The Lord can lead thee, whoſe property it is to ſhew his mercy then greateſt, when neareſt to be utterly deſpaired off: to doe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt things by contraries. To deale with men as he did with <hi>Pauls</hi> paſſengers, to break the ſhip on which they bottome themſelves, &amp; yet to bring them to land. Thou had que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned the Churches being before <hi>Luther</hi> in another letter; thou art anſwered: but becauſe thou art never likely to ſee it, marke this one thing more, which I ſhall now tell thee, touching Gods providence in anſwer to that rotten queſtion. God hath and doth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14625:75"/> doe great things by <hi>Aſhur,</hi> he layes waſt, and cuts downe not a few: But the Lord will never doe a great thing for <hi>Aſhur.</hi> What is that? The Lord will never make his Arme bare for <hi>Aſhur;</hi> he will never ſhew himſelfe in the Mount to <hi>Aſhur:</hi> he will never ſtrike off his charet wheels, and yet bring him ſafe to ſhore, when they goe heavily, he ſinkes like a ſtone. This <hi>giving an iſſue, this opening the waters, this paving a path in the wilderneſſe, is Abrahams prerogative royall:</hi> I meane the Churches portion for ever. Ancient dayes can ſpeake this, the following ſhall declare it. Conſider this, thou lookeſt beyond <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> It cleares our eyes too. <hi>Iacob</hi> is ſmall, his hands hang downe; <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſhip is almoſt broke: he will ſinke ſure. No, this doeth but unbottome him; ſee him rouling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon Gods providence, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, till the Lord make bare his Arme in all the peoples ſight; ſo carrying him to the place, where he would be, as <hi>upon the wings of an Eagle.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham as dying lives by faith,</hi> whoſe propertie it is to reſt on God moſt, when it ſees leaſt; to relie on God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meanes, againſt meanes.</p>
               <p>Now but one word to thee Reader, before I leave the Churches treaſure, Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Thou art yet in no ſtrait: That is a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14625:75"/> wonder. Doth the fire claſpe the houſe, and is thy chamber in ſafety? doth it not ſmell of the ſmoke? then God is exceeding pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent towards thee, as appeareth this day; yet canſt thou not diſcerne the wind, &amp; which way it beares the flame? If thou thinkſt not, thou maiſt be in a ſtrait ſhortly, thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt nothing: and if thou conſidereſt it; thou wilt be never the ſooner io it, but the further from it. In the meane time thou haſt heard with thy eares, and <hi>Iobs</hi> meſſengers have told thee, that there is one at this day, in a ſtrait, and ſees no meanes, (thou maiſt be ſure it is the Church) in a wilderneſſe, &amp; can diſcerne no path. What doe we, man, for hir, what ſhall we doe for our ſelves? what? <hi>We know not what to doe; our eyes are onely to thee O Lord:</hi> then it went well with <hi>Iehoſophat.</hi> I have done with this mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away his goods, and then himſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches treaſure: <hi>We muſt iudge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time, he that iudgeth is the Lord, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>

Now let us conſider: The Lord hath his Temple, and living ſtones are daily laid upon it.
